SECURE YOUR OWN WI-FI NETWORK

In this project, I conducted a Wi-Fi security assessment on my home network to identify weak passwords, open ports, and unauthorized devices. I used tools like Wireshark, Aircrack-ng, and Nmap for the analysis. The final deliverable was a report detailing the vulnerabilities found and providing recommendations to enhance network security.
