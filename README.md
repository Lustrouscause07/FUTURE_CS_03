SECURE YOUR OWN WI-FI NETWORK

In this project, I conducted a Wi-Fi security assessment on my home network to identify weak passwords, open ports, and unauthorized devices. The analysis emphasizes the importance of using strong encryption protocols like WPA3 to safeguard data in transit. It also underscores the need for continuous monitoring of connected devices to detect unusual activity or rogue devices attempting to join the network. Additionally, properly securing network configurations—such as disabling WPS, changing default credentials, and segmenting networks for different user groups—plays a vital role in reducing attack surfaces.
